# Spiritual Gifts Test Application

This application serves as a tool to test and assess an individual's spiritual gifts through a series of structured questions. It provides an interactive way to discover and understand personal spiritual strengths.

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm/bun installed.

To set up the project locally:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spiritual-gifts-test.git
    cd spiritual-gifts-test
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The application will auto-update as you edit the source files.
